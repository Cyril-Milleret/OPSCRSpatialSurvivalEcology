# OPSCRSpatialSurvivalEcology
Repository containing R files and data to reproduce the analysis presented in Milleret et al Estimating spatially variable and density-dependent survival using open-population spatial capture-recapture models; Ecology

The repository contains Rmarkdown files and corresponding html document to :
1.Run an OPSCR model where mortality is cause-specific and spatially heterogenous
2.Run an OPSCR model where mortality density-dependent
3.Run an OPSCR model on a Scandinavian wovlerine dataset where mortality is cause-specific, spatially heterogenous and a function of density.
